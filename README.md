## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to discuss a few methods to preprocess images before they are ingested into the model building process.

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that covers various techniques in digital image processing using OpenCV. The notebook includes examples and code snippets for noise removal, image sharpening and  contrast enhancement. Advanced techniques using deep learning models like EDSR, Real-ESRGAN, and GFP-GAN for super-resolution and image enhancement are also demonstrated.
